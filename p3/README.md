allocate on the stack and assign pointers in an ongoing basis (if a variable is a string, conditionally reference)
perform the necessary operations for branching (storing the return values necessary)

make sure to edit the interception graph on HW4 to accomodate for LVIN

adjust the left value assignment to just include the name of the variable (assign)
